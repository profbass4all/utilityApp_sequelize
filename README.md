Hi, 

This is a basic utility App.

It allows users to create a wallet and fund it through paystack.

Users can buy airtime through wallet.

Only authenticated users can have a wallet and fund it.

Unauthenticated users can also take advantage of the app but will have to pay through paystack.

Some endpoints are accesible by only admins while others are for both admins and users.

Caching mechanism was implemented using redis while jwt was used for authentication.

sequelize orm was the choice for this project MySql DB was chosen for easy implementation.
